# Color-Sorter-Machine

Abstract:
For sorting object in industry optical sorting is very much convenient. Color and size are the most important features for accurate classification and sorting of product which can be done by using some optical sensors or analyzing their pictures. The color sorting machine is mainly a device that can sense the different color of the object and assert them into different containers. When the object moves from one place to another with the rotation of motor, sensors as the input devices will send signal to microcontroller where microcontroller as the controller will give command to the actuator to do action. 

This project describes a working prototype designed for automatic sorting of objects based on the color. OPT101 sensor was used to detect the color of the product and the STM microcontroller was used to control the overall process. The identification of the color is based on the ADC value of the output of OPT101 sensor. Two Servo motors were used, each controlled by the microcontroller. The first motor is used for carrying the product to be analyzed by the color sensor, and the second motor is used for sorting the product according to the reading taken by the color sensor, into the separate containers.

Motivation: The main advantages of this system is it requires less time to sort the product, as the whole system is performed by machine there is less possibility of mistake, less man power required. If the industry can produce the product within the required range then the demand of the product will be increased. So, the company will be benefited.Since in order to reduce the human labor and avoid the negligence caused by them in case of hurry this automatic color sorter machine can easily can provide ease to the problem and sort the product accordingly thus giving a good efficiency and accurate results.
